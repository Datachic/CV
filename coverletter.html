Dear Employer,<br>
<br>
Kindly find attached my CV in application for the position being offered in your organisation.
I found out about the position on internet job search and I believe it is perfect for me.<br />
<br />
As a graduate of Computer Science, I possess a strong background in applications development and maintenance.
After completing the one year mandatory National Youth Service Corps, I started my first official job at IBTC Chartered Bank PLC
 (now Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC) as a Software Developer in the IT department. My first assignment allowed me to put into practice
 the theories and skills I acquired in school. Part of my job portfolio included designing and maintaining in-house programs
 and databases related to banking. To maintain a strong family unit, I moved to a new state with my family <br><br>
 I moved to retail banking where I worked in all
 the units in banking operations. These jobs presented unique challenges as I moved away from my comfort zone of computers and programing
  to dealing with people. I had to learn everything on-the-Job and my communication, interpersonal and leadership skills were
  brought to the fore. I rose to head of operations in 2010 and I held this position untill April 2014 when I left banking.<br/>
<br>
My final year dissertation in 2004 was ‚ÄòWeb-based Course Registration System for University Of Lagos‚Äô.
I worked directly with my supervisor on this project because we believed that automating the student‚Äôs course registration process
 would make it more efficient thereby resulting in considerable reduction of time and money wasted by students and the school.
 I feel very proud to have helped pioneered this fete. <br>
<br>
 Over the years, I continued to monitor the process in the school and I am
 glad to see that online course registration has become the norm in most Nigerian universities.<br>
 .
<br>
My career goal is to continue to grow, to take up new challenges to revive myself whilst adding value to my work place.
I want to demonstrate the skills and expertise I have gathered in all my years in banking to an organization where hard
workers are recognised, developed and awarded.<br>
<br>
I am open to being taken on as a fulltime, parttime, remote/freelance Software Developer in your Corporation and
I welcome the opportunity to hear from you regarding a personal interview.
Thank you for your consideration. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mary Ovonimo Alabi

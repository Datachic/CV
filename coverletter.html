<p class="cover">Dear Employer,<br>
<br>
Kindly find attached my CV in application for the position being offered in your organization.
I found out about the position on the internet job search and I believe it is perfect for me.
<br />
<br />
As a graduate of Computer Science, I possess a strong background in software development and maintenance.
After completing the mandatory One-Year National Youth Service Corps in February 2007, I started my first
official job at IBTC Chartered Bank PLC (now Stanbic IBTC Bank PLC) as a <b>Software Developer</b>.  My role
included designing various programs to support in-house apps and to manage out-sourced Apps. My first
challenging assignment was to build and manage a Career Website and Database which was plugged into the
 Bank's live website. A project I single-handedly managed and I had to sort through thousands of CVs on
 the Database daily for worthy candidates after which I then forward these lists to HR for action. Hundreds
 of applicants were recruited between 2007 and 2010. This experience allowed me to put into practice the
 theories and skills I acquired in school.

<br><br>
  To maintain a strong family unit, I move to a new state with my family where I had to switch jobs to
  <b>Retail Banking</b>. I worked in all the units in Banking Operations. These jobs presented unique
  challenges as I moved away from my comfort zone of computers and programming to managing people and to
  Customer Service. I had to learn everything on the job where my communication, interpersonal, and leadership
  skills were brought to the fore. I rose to the post of <b>Head of Operations/Service & Support Manager</b>
  in 2009 and I held this position till 2014 when I left banking.<br/>
<br>
My final year dissertation in 2005 was 'Web-based Course Registration System for University Of Lagos'. I worked
directly with my supervisor on this project because we believed that automating the student's course registration
 process would make it more efficient thereby resulting in a considerable reduction of time and money wasted by
 students and the school. I feel very proud to have helped pioneer this fete.<br>
<br>
<br>

After a 3year sabbatical leave which availed me the opportunity to focus on my young family, I re-entered the
tech environment by getting myself abreast of the current trends in software development, sharpening my old
problem-solving skills and building my portfolio.<br><br>
My career goal is to continue to grow, to take up new challenges to revive myself whilst adding value to my
workplace. I want to demonstrate the skills and expertise I have gathered in all my years in banking to an
organization where hard workers are recognized, developed, and awarded.<br>
<br>
I am open to being taken on as a Full-time, Part-time, Remote/Freelance Software Developer in your Corporation
and I welcome the opportunity to hear from you regarding a personal interview. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your consideration.
